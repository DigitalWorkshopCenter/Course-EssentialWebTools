            <h6>Much of this section comes from <a href="https://blog.idrsolutions.com/2018/07/what-is-a-package-manager-and-why-should-you-use-one/" target="_blank">idrsolutions.com</a> </h6>
            <h2>What is a package manager and why is it useful?</h2>
            <p>A package manager is a programming language’s tool to create project environments and easily import external dependencies. You don’t have to reinvent the wheel and are able to make the most of the tools at your disposal. When working on a project or library, you may “package” your project and publish it for others. </p>
            <p>You can usually specify dependencies, a package name, author, tags/keywords and version number. All this helps online repositories store your package and allows others to find your project. Furthermore by allowing you to create your own packages, developers are challenged to think about how their package will be used and implemented, in turn producing better and more reusable packages. </p>
            <h2>Popular package manager overview</h2>
            <h4>Python – Managers: pip / conda, Repository: pypi</h4>
            <p>Python is an increasingly popular language and is constantly evolving. “pip” allows you to effortlessly add dependencies to your projects for your given python instalments. </p>
            <p>A slightly different approach to package management exist in the form of VirtualEnv and Anaconda. Both implement the concept of creating virtual environments for a given project, this environment includes a fresh python installation for a given version along with the ability to install packages specific to that project. </p>
            <p>Where the two differ is that VirtualEnv works with essentially a blank slate python installation and uses pip to install dependencies. In contrast, Anaconda has additional dependencies built-in for data-science tasks and does not use pip. ‘conda’, which is a separate package manager with data-science-related packages, is provided with every Anaconda installation. It does however have built-in compatability with pip to allow for adding packages not available in conda. </p>
            <p>For the purpose of simplicity, I think using VirtualEnv allows for the cleanest implementation of package management. You can separate out your projects to only include what you need and avoid global installs you might only be using in a single project. Albeit, the only exception to this is if you are only working on data-science tasks and have no need for additional installations. </p>
            <h4>Java – Managers: Maven and Gradle, Repository: Maven Central</h4>
            <p>Java has two main options for package management, Maven is the industry standard. Maven Central Repository is an online repository containing a vast array of packages available for use in your projects. In contrast, Gradle is a relatively new package management solutions that has grown rapidly over recent years due to a less-verbose syntax and faster build times. Java is the only one of these examples where you cannot simply add your own packages to the main repository. Approved repository hosting services such as Sonatype Nexus OSS must vet and agree to host your package on their platform.</p>
            <p>In terms of choosing one over the other, for existing applications it is likely Maven is already integrated and moving over to Gradle would have considerable overhead. However, Gradle is less verbose, immediately speeds up builds and will likely continue to increase in popularity. </p>
            <h4>JavaScript – Manager and Repository: npm</h4>
            <p>npm is the package manager for JavaScript. It is the world’s largest software repository. npm hosts extremely popular packages like jQuery, Bootstrap, React, Angular etc. Linking your GitHub repository with npm also allows you to create and share your own projects. As the npm online repository is so large and diverse, JavaScript front-end and Node.js backend developers make use of npm as the packages can be used in either environment. </p>
            <h4>PHP – Manager: Composer, Repository: Packagist</h4>
            <p>Composer is the package manager for PHP along with Packagist which is the main PHP package repository. Composer challenges PHP’s traditional single-script server usage by allowing package imports. Furthermore, Composer allows imports to be used traditionally from a server endpoint or simply from running scripts via the command line interchangeably. </p>
            <p>Like npm, linking GitHub and Packagist allows for seamless deployment to the platform. </p>
            <h2>Use packages!</h2>
            <p>Now that I’ve described a bunch of package managers and their corresponding repositories, I would highly suggest experimenting with them. Try creating a project, import some dependencies and use them! You will quickly realise the importance of re-usable packages outside of the built-in scope and see how simply you can make use of them via package management. </p>
            <p>Finally, if you feel comfortable using packages and find yourself programming something others might find useful, create your own! Create a library or project and deploy it to the corresponding public repository. </p>

            <h2><a href="https://scotch.io/tutorials/a-beginners-guide-to-composer" target="_blank">A Beginner's Guide to Composer</a></h2>
            <p>Since its release on March 1st, 2012 Composer has gained widespread popularity for bringing something to PHP which was sorely needed: dependency management. Composer is essentially a way to pull in all the third party software such as CSS frameworks, jQuery plugins and others into your project.</p>
            <p>I'm sure there are plenty of coders out there who are wondering about the benefits of using composer and many who are afraid to make the leap into a new system. In this article we'll take a look at what exactly Composer is, what it does and why it is a great tool for PHP projects.</p>
            <p>First we'll take a broader scope look at dependency management and then install composer. We'll take a general look at usage and then flesh out some of the basics. Let's get started!</p>
            <h2>What Is Dependency Management?</h2>
            <p>Dependency management is actually a pretty simple concept. Let's assume you're creating a one-page website using the <a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Foundation</a> framework for your Javascript and CSS needs. How do you make sure that Foundation is added to your project?</p>
            <p>The usual approach is to go to the website, download the package and place it somewhere within your project. So far so good. Now, what do you do when you want to update to the latest version? You repeat the same thing, overwriting the old version.</p>
            <p>Let's assume this goes on for a while and you realize something is broken. They've changed something in Foundation and now you have to roll back, but where to? You'll need to find the older versions and start applying them until you find the right one.</p>
            <p>Even if you sort all that out, let's say you move onto someone else's project. Are they using Foundation as well? If so, where is it installed and what version is it?</p>
            <p>These may not seem like huge issues for a small project but imagine a project with 8-10 dependencies - which still isn't a lot. Managing everything modularly becomes impossible or - at the very least - a waste of time.</p>
            <p>Dependency management solves these problems by <strong>automating</strong> and <strong>standardizing</strong>. The retrieval of dependencies such as Foundation, jQuery, Twig, Symphony, logging modules and so on can be done programmatically. Preferred versions can also be designated which protects against conflicts.</p>

            <h2><a href="https://www.cloudbees.com/blog/node-js-tutorial" target="_blank">The Beginner's Guide to Node.js</a></h2>
            <p>There's no shortage of Node.js tutorials out there, but most of them cover specific use cases or topics that only apply when you've already got Node up and running. I see comments every once and awhile that sound something like, "I've downloaded Node, now what?" This tutorial answers that question and explains how to get started from the very beginning.</p>
            <h2>What is Node.js?</h2>
            <p>A lot of the confusion for newcomers to Node is misunderstanding exactly what it is. The description on nodejs.org definitely doesn't help.</p>
            <p>An important thing to realize is that Node is not a webserver. By itself it doesn't do anything. It doesn't work like Apache. There is no config file where you point it to you HTML files. If you want it to be a HTTP server, you have to write an HTTP server (with the help of its built-in libraries). Node.js is just another way to execute code on your computer. It is simply a JavaScript runtime.</p>
            <h2>What is NPM?</h2>
            <p>There are thousands of modules available that solve almost all typical problems that you're likely to encounter. Remember to check <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/libraries" target="_blank">npm</a> before re-inventing the wheel. It's not unheard of for a typical Node.js application to have dozens of dependencies.</p>
            <p>If you have a lot of dependencies in a project, we'll want to use a package manager. That's why npm makes use of a package.json file.</p>
            <p>A package.json file contains an overview of your application. There are a lot of available fields, but this is pretty much the minimum. The dependencies section describes the name and version of the modules you'd like to install. In this case I'll accept any version of Express 3.3. You can list as many dependencies as you want in this section.</p>
            <p>Now instead of installing each dependency separately, we can run a single command and install all of them.</p>
